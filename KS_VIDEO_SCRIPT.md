Hey Kickstarter, My name is Matthew and I want to help fellow kickstarter project creators reach their stretch goals, what they would like to achieve above and beyond their original idea.

Recently I backed the Ghost Blogging platform project and twelve hours later it was funded. Shocked, amazed, honored, the project creator posted his stretch goal. But unlike other stretch goals I've seen recently he didn't just say "If we raise more than we'll do more" he said "if we raise 250,000 we will do x y and z" and then he added an image to the project description that introed his stretch goal and showed their progress towards it.

I think this approach has greatly increased Ghost's chance of hitting their ambitious goal but while writing a blog post with hard fast numbers does a lot to encourage people to give a bit more, embedding an up to the minute progress bar keeps the goal fresh and helps remind possible gifters why donating to an funded project is worth it. Of course, embedding this image isn't just a walk in the park.

That is where Stretch Goal comes in. For the last handful of days I've been tweaking a prototype that creates an up to date image which can be embedded into kickstarter and I'm ready to start letting project creators use the service, but first I need to do some house keeping.

That is where you come in. We need to buy a domain and provision funds for server costs. 

A tool like this won't need much to get off the ground and since we're giving the product away for free here are our pledge gifts.

for one dollar I'll add your name to the contributors page.

for five dollars I'll add your name to the contributors page in bold font.

for 10 dollars I'll give you access to submit stretch goals for stretch goal encase we need to stretch goal.

and for 25 dollars I will send you a "HOW TO STRETCH: THE PDF" written by Wikipedia, art by Google Image search and edited by yours truly.

Thank you Kickstarter, please help me get this project off the ground.
